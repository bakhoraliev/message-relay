# Message Relay Patterns

After reading an article about [Transactional Outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html) pattern on microservices.io, I discorvered that there are no good educational examples of the [Transaction Log Tailing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html) and [Polling Publisher](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/polling-publisher.html) patterns on either the website or GitHub. So I decided to fill this gap and create a repository that would serve as a logical continuation of the article.

## Requirements

- Read articles on microservices.io about [Transactional Outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html), [Transaction Log Tailing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html) and [Polling Publisher](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/polling-publisher.html).
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker / Docker Compose 

## Polling Publisher


## Transaction Log Tailing
