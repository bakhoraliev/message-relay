# Message Relay Patterns

A set of simple and illustrative implementations of Message Relay patterns — Polling Publisher and Transaction Log Tailing — designed for both beginners and advanced developers. This repository focuses on making the algorithms behind these patterns clear, accessible, and easy to reproduce, without complex production-level abstractions.

## Motivation

Learning data integration patterns for microservices often ends in confusion due to either fragmentary descriptions or over-complicated production-ready implementations. When researching Polling Publisher and Transaction Log Tailing on microservices.io, I found a lack of clear, minimal, and educational code samples — both on the website and on GitHub.
This repository aims to close that gap: to be the go-to source for anyone seeking to understand and experiment with practical Message Relay algorithms in straightforward Python code, free from unnecessary boilerplate and advanced framework usage.
